Block Merchant was the third flash game I wrote.  My goal was to make the improvements to a certain popular 80's game that rhymes with "netris" that I'd always wished it had while playing it as a kid.  I added a shop with a greedy pig merchant who will sell you blocks and a few power-ups!

I spent a lot of time in the beginning of 2010 on this game from my apartment in Beijing.  It was a great growth time both in terms of making basic computer art and making the largest piece of software I had to date.  It was actually a lot more of a struggle than I'd expected.  It was once I realized that I needed to abstract the logic of the grid in the game from the graphics, that I really got going.  It was this game that lead me to getting my first job at a software start-up.

I haven't really touched Block Merchant in a long time, but anyone wants to refactor the code or add more features, I'd love to see it!

These are the blog posts I wrote whild making it:
